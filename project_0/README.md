### 2. What is the challenge
Goal of the project is to optimize guessing algorithm to minimize number of guesses.

**Rules of the game**
- Computer is making a random array of 1000 numbers to be guessed (range 1-100).
- Computer is trying to guess a number based on information if guessed number is smaller or bigger, and records number os guesses.
- Guessing algorithm should be developped to achieve <20 guesses on average.

**Success KPI**

Average number of guesses <20.

### 4. Result
Achieved average number of guesses is 16 (compared to >100 before optimization).
